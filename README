Calculate information about the phase of the moon at a given time.
 
Based on the Perl module Astro::MoonPhase, version 0.60.

This is a functional code example (more like the original perl modules),
however an OO variant can be found here: https://github.com/inetlover/moonphase

Astro::MoonPhase module is distributed under the public domain,
and therefore so is this PHP translation.
